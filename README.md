# This is my current profile and portfolio site.
It has a few features:
1. A markdown based "CMS". Basically It acccepts a copied markdown file through the django admin to create posts.
2. A data engineering portfolio project. I used the publically available NYC taxi data to build a duckdb based API using django rest framework. IT's just a client, and uses cached parquet files to return results
3. A frontend project in react that consumes the NYC taxi API and displays a map view and some various stats. I used AI to write this, it's not my forte, but it seemed like a bare API made for a poor portfolio project.
4. The about page features a basic resume for me
